        You call me all friendly
        Tellin' me how much you miss me
        That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
        Well, I'm too busy for your business
        Go find a girl who wants to listen
        'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong
        
        [Pre-Chorus]
        So I cut you off
        I don't need your love
        'Cause I already cried enough
        I've been done
        I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
        I cut you off
        I don't need your love
        So you can try all you want
        Your time is up, I'll tell you why
        
        [Chorus]
        You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
        So save it, get gone, shut up
        'Cause if you think I care about you now
        Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
        
        [Verse 2]
        I remember that weekend
        When my best friend caught you creepin'
        You blamed it all on the alcohol
        So, I made my decision
        'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
        Play the victim and switch your position
        I'm through, I'm done</pre>
